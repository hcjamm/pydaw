About:

LibModSynth is a C/C++ language library that makes it quick and easy to develop high quality DSSI plugins.  LibModSynth also comes with a suite of plugins based on the library.

How to use:



Musicians:

Be sure to download the correct version for your architecture(32 or 64 bit).

The plugins will always install to /usr/local/lib/dssi .  If you're using a DAW/Sequencer/Tracker, be sure that it is set to look for DSSI plugins in that directory.

Standalone use:

To play a LibModSynth plugin without a DAW, download the jack-dssi-host I've provided for your architecture (32 or 64 bit).  Instructions are in the tar.gz file.




For developers:

The library is not yet feature complete, and until it is, I may at any time break forward compatibilty of your code without warning.  If you'd like to use it, you can get the latest version from GIT, however, the documentation is incomplete, and what is there is already out of date.  Otherwise, I would advise waiting until I declare the API to be stable and feature complete, which I anticipate happening by mid-2012 at the latest.
