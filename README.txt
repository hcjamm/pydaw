About: 

LibModSynth is a C/C++ library that makes it quick and easy to develop high quality DSSI plugins. LibModSynth also comes with a suite of plugins based on the library. 

How to compile and install from the source code.

I've written a script to make this easy.  Compile and install with these commands:

	cd ~/Desktop/libmodsynth-git  #Or wherever you untarred the tar.gz file if not on your desktop
	perl compile_and_install.pl

This will compile and install all of the plugins.

Documentation:

Documentation is in the "doc" folder.  In here, you will find instructions for compiling, using, packaging and developing with LibModSynth and the LibModSynth plugin suite.
