Hello,

If you're reading this, you probably want to know the best and easiest way to package the LibModSynth suite.  So let's get started.

1.  The libmodsynth library is meant to be a source-based developer system, not a shared library.  Please don't try to package it.

2.  The plugins can be built into a single .deb by running these commands

	git clone yada/yada..  #If you're reading this, you've probably already done this step
	cd libmodsynth-git
	git tag
	#pick out the version you want to checkout
	git checkout tag_you_want_to_build
	perl build-all.pl
	#answer some question

At the end of build.all.pl, you'll be given the choice to build or not build the package.  If not, you can use these commands:

	cd ../lms_suite
	#make whatever modifications you want
	dpkg-deb --build deb
	mv deb.deb lms_suite_version_etc.deb

3.  Cross-compiling:  Currently, it only builds for the architecture you're using.  I build the 64 bit packages on my developer workstation, and the 32bit packages in a 32bit VM of Ubuntu.

4.  Non-deb distros:  I'll add alternative packaging to the build-all.pl script if people request it(or better yet, if they assist in creating a packaging script for it).
