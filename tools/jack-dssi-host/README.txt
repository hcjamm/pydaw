How to use jack-dssi-host:

cd [to the directory you put jack-dssi-host in]
jack-dssi-host /usr/local/lib/dssi/ray_v.so   #or any other DSSI .so file you with to run

You can save the above 2 lines to a text file, and name it ray_v.sh (or whatever you want to call it), and run the script by either double clicking it, or by running it like this:

bash ./ray_v.sh
