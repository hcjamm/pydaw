This is a list of things with a high priority:

ADSR Envelope:  Allow zero for attack time, start at 1, decay stage if so.

Envelopes:  Change math to avoid division

ADSR amp:  Change to zero to 1 scale, since the envelope now uses db_to_amp calculation of the filter output

That weird white noise burst on the classic 5th pad preset

Is something off about the pitch now?  (maybe not, or maybe it was wrong, but now it's right)

Create #defines in libmodsynth.h that will be used to centralize things like plugin name, uuid, etc... when forking.
