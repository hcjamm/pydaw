This directory contains files and scripts for providing distro-independent packaging for LibModSynth and various 3rd party components.  

At the present, there is no intention to provide .deb or .rpm packages, as the philosophy of the project is to distribute standalone executable files as much as possible, so users can have bleeding edge software without getting into the dependency conflicts that go along with distributing bleeding edge software using PPAs and distro package managers.
