This is a list of things with a high priority:

Move the source files into a /src/ directory, fix the autotools files, and rename the scripts used to build ray-v

Remove extraneous autotools files from the repo, let them be regenerated by a build script

Create perl script for debugging the current plugin like Ray-v, automatically compiling jack-dssi-host if not compiled

 ADSR Envelope:  Allow zero for attack time, start at 1, decay stage if so.

Envelopes:  Change math to avoid division

ADSR amp:  Change to zero to 1 scale, since the envelope now uses db_to_amp calculation of the filter output

Glide:  Use ramp envelope instead of smoother, to allow an easier-to-implement rate option, instead of just time.  Add a glide.h file with
functions and function pointers to be used with glide.

Lost notes on some chords

That weird white noise burst on the classic 5th pad preset

Adding something akin to LMS_FIRST_CONTROL_PORT and LMS_LAST_CONTROL_PORT to synth.h

Make Ray-V stereo

Add an initial "None" entry to the preset dropdown, and -1 the program number
