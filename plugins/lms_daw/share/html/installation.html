<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>
<h2>2.1 How to Obtain MusE</h2>
MusE is available at the MusE Homepage, located at
<a href="http://www.muse-sequencer.org/">http://www.muse-sequencer.org/</a>.
Download the latest non-beta release and follow the
installation instructions below.

<h2>2.2 System Requirements</h2>
To run MusE on your workstation, the following conditions must be met:
<ul>
  <li>A GNU/Linux distribution (Red Hat, Debian, etc.)
  <li>A working windowing system (most likely X Windows)
  <li>qt 2.2 (<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt</a>)
  <li>gcc 2.95.2 (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>)
  <li>glibc 2.1 (<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc</a>)
  <li>Linux kernel configured with RealTimeClock support (<tt>/dev/rtc</tt>)
  <li>ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) 0.5.9c (it should work with standard OSS drivers as well)
  <li>an external midi device
</ul>

<h2>2.3 Compiliation and Installation</h2>
Unpack the newly-downloaded tarball into a directory and edit
the file <tt>make.inc</tt>.
<p>
The most important variables to set in this file are:
<ul>
  <li>QTDIR
  <li>ALSA
  <li>OSS
</ul>

Point <tt>QTDIR</tt> to where your QT libraries are installed.
<tt>ALSA</tt> and <tt>OSS</tt> are boolean values (ie. <tt>yes</tt>
or <tt>no</tt>) that tell MusE how to handle Midi and Audio on your
system.  It is safe to say <tt>yes</tt> to both.
<p>
A sample config:
<p>
<pre>
	QTDIR = /usr/local/qt
	ALSA = no
	OSS = yes
</pre>

<p>
When done, save <tt>make.inc</tt> and run the following commands:
<pre>
	make depend
	make
	make install
</pre>

<p>
Note that <tt>make install</tt> will ask for the <tt>root</tt> password,
as MusE is installed as a setuid-root binary.  Setuid-root is needed to allow
MusE to get proper timing functions from the Linux kernel.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> To get even better timing than that, run MusE with the -R option.
