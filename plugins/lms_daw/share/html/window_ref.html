<h2>4. Window Reference Guide</h2>
<p>
<h2>4.1 The Main Window</h2>
Here's a screenshot of the main window, with a standard MIDI file already
loaded:
<p>
<img src="main_window.jpg"</img>

<p>
The main window is basically divided up into two panes separated by a
veritcal bar that is movable horizontally.  These two panes together
are called the Arranger.

<h2>4.2 The Arranger</h2>
<p>
The left pane of the Arranger describes each track in detail,
while the right pane describes each track graphically.

<h3>4.2.1 The Left Pane</h3>
<img src="left_pane.jpg"</img>
<p>
The left pane details the following information for each track:
<ul>
  <li>A -??
  <li>M - Mute the track
  <li>C - Defines whether the track is one of MIDI, Drum or Wave.
  <li>Track - A freely-editable track name.
  <li>Ch - Defines which MIDI Channel this track plays on.
  <li>Port - Defines which MIDI port this track plays on.
  <li>T -??
</ul>

You can select which track is currently "active" by simply clicking
on the track.
<p>
When a track's M column is clicked, that track is marked as Muted with
a red circle and upon playback that track will not be heard.  To hear
the track, click on the M column for that track again.
<p>
Right click on the C column for a track to declare the track to be of
type MIDI, Drum or Wave.
<p>
The Track column is free-form, meaning that a double-click on a track's
Track column will allow you to enter a descriptive name for the track,
for example "Hot Lead Guitar".
<p>
The Ch column for a track is changed by right-clicking to increment the
number or middle-clicking to decrement the number.  It's generally a
good idea to keep differing instruments on different MIDI channels and it's
considered common to have the drum kit on channel 10.
<p>
<h4>4.2.1.1 Track Info</h4>
<p>
At the bottom of the left pane, you'll see a little button labelled
"TrackInfo".  When clicked, the standard information plus more about
the currently selected track is presented:
<p>
<img src="track_info.jpg"</img>
<ul>
  <li>Track Name
  <li>Channel
  <li>Transpose
  <li>Delay
  <li>Length
  <li>Velocity
  <li>Compr
</ul>
The bottom half of the TrackInfo display describes MIDI channel information:
<ul>
  <li>MIDI Instrument
  <li>H-Bank
  <li>L-Bank
  <li>Progr
  <li>Volume
  <li>Pan
</ul>

<p>
Operations that can be performed on the left pane:

<h2>4.2.2 The Right Pane</h2>
<img src="right_pane.jpg"</img>
<p>
The right pane desribes each track graphically.  Time moves from left
to right and is measured in beats that are referenced at the top of
the right pane.  Tracks are displayed vertically in boxes, called
"Parts", that depict where MIDI and audio data are played.
<p>
The small sliders that are adjacent to the bottom right corner affect
the view of the right pane in terms of "zooming".  The vertical slider
affects the height of the tracks, while the horizontal slider affects
the width.
<p>
Operations that can be performed on the right pane:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><td><b>To do this...</b><td><b>...Do this</b>
<tr><td>Select Part<td>Left Click
<tr><td>Select multiple parts<td>Shift + left click
<tr><td>Change selected track<td>Key left: previous part, Key right: next part
<tr><td>Move part<td>Drag with left mouse button
<tr><td>Create new part<td>select Pencil tool; draw with left mouse button pressed, OR set left and right mark; double click on track

<h2>4.2.3 The Button Bar &amp; Menus</h2>
<img src="button_bar.jpg"</img>
<p>
Across the top, above the Arranger, are a menu system, icons and other
widgets that you use to manipulate your project.  Most of these are
self-explanatory, while others are described later in this document.
