<h2>5. Getting Started</h2>
<p>
<h2>5.1 Creating A New Song</h2>
<p>
Here's a very short tutorial on how to create a new song from scratch.

<p>

<ol>
  <li> Start MusE with the name of a new song (ie. a filename that doesn't
already exist):
<pre>
	muse blues1.med
</pre>
Alternatively, start MusE and select <tt>File-&gt;New</tt>.  The default song
name is <tt>default</tt> and the first time you select <tt>File-&gt;Save</tt>,
MusE asks you for a real name.

  <li> Select a song type from the <tt>Type</tt> pulldown menu in the
Toolbar.  This selects the capabilities of your MIDI hardware (either
NO, GM, GS, or XG).

  <li> Doubleclick on the first empty track to create a new track.
  <li> Select the MIDI channel for the new track; click with the right mouse
button on Ch column in the track list to increment channel nummber, click
with middle mouse button to decrement.
  <li> If the TrackInfo window is not visible, press TrackInfo.
  <li> Select a MIDI instrument for the MIDI channel of your new track.
  <li> Click with the middle mouse button on ruler to set left locator mark.
  <li> Click with the right mouse button on the ruler to set right locator mark.
<b>Note:</b> The right mark must be set to the right of the left mark.
  <li> Double click between the left and right locators on first track to
create a new part, <b>or</b> select the Pencil tool and draw with the left
mouse button pressed to create a new part.
</ol>

<p>
<h2>5.2 Recording Events</h2>
<p>
<b>Entering Notes Manually</b>

<ol>
  <li> Select Pointer tool from toolbar 
  <li> Double click on part in part canvas to start the pianoroll editor 
  <li> Select Pencil tool from toolbar in the pianoroll editor 
  <li> Now you can draw events into the event canvas 
</ol>

<p>
<b>Play The Notes</b>

<ol>
  <li> Click with middle mouse button on ruler to set left locator mark 
  <li> Click with right mouse button on ruler to set right locator mark
  <li> Note: right mark must be set right to left mark 
  <li> Click with left mouse button on ruler to set current position between left and right locator 
  <li> Select "loop" in the transport toolbar 
  <li> Press play to start sequencer

</ol>

<p>
<b>Some Hints</b>

  <li> You can change Channel Info and Track Info values during play 
</ol>

<p>
<h2>5.3 Step Recording</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Start the pianoroll editor 
  <li> Click with left mouse button on ruler to set current position to the start position of your recording 
  <li> Set the Snap value to the step distance 
  <li> Set the Quantize value to the length of the notes to record 
  <li> Enter step record mode by pressing the "S" toolbar button 
  <li> Every click on the piano keyboard records a note with "Quantize" len and advances the current record position to
  <li> The next "Snap" position 
  <li> Shift+click records a note without advancing the current record position 
  <li> Change the current position with the cursor keys 
  <li> Shift+space inserts a gap; all notes to the right of the current position move to the next snap position 
</ol>
