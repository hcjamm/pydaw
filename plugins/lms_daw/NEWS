MusE 0.7:
      New features:

      - MusE now depends on JACK; midi event timing is coupled
        to JACK timing i.e
      - simpler integration of internal software synthesizer;
        midi events are now delivered directly to synthesizer without
        ALSA. This eleminates the need of an extra realtime thread
        for every synthesizer instance.
      - instrument definition files "*.idf" files now describe
        available midi controller for instrument
      - software synthesizer show available midi controller
        with name in controller editor pulldown
      - 14 bit midi controllers (RPN'n NRPN's) can be handled in
        graphical controller editor
      - imported midi can be added to current song
      - "New" now shows a selection of template songs to start with
      - Keyboard shortcuts editor: most (all?) shortcuts can now be changed at
        runtime.
      - Redesigned audio-mixer with much improved routing capabilities
        towards JACK.
      - Track types extended, input, output, group, aux, wavetrack,
        softsynth, miditrack, drumtrack
      - The beginings of automation, only volume/pan at the moment.
      - Improved RT performance, xruns should be a thing of the past. :)
      - JACK transport integration
      - support of JACK "freewheel" mode
      - extended configuration - configurable shortcuts
