----------
Descripion
----------

DeicsOnze is a virtual synthesizer plugin for MusE which reproduces the
FM synthesis of the YAMAHA DX11 synthesizer/TX81Z sound module.

-------
Remarks
-------

It contains over 2000 presets archived by Bryan Sutula belonging to the public
domain. If by any chance you find some of them that are under copyright please
contact me to take them off.

Not every function is implemented but it's already sounding like the original
(even better). Pitch bend, modulation and some others are not implemented yet.

The files with the extention .fig in the directory pics have been made 
with xfig.

-----------
Compilation
-----------

DeicsOnze is compiled with the optimization -O3. This permits it to be
twice faster than without optimization, however the compilation time is longer
(10 minutes on my Athlon XP-M 2000) and may not pass on any machine. If not
remove -O3 in the file CMakeLists.txt.

----
Help
----

The last features (portamento and pitch envelope) have been implemented
without DX11 only with the documentation. If you have a DX11 or TX81Z I need
you! Please record your sound with different values of portamento and pitch
envelope and send it to me so I can adjust the paramenter of DeicsOnze to fit
the real DX11.
