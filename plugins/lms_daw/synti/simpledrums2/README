Simpledrums v 0.2, by Mathias Lundgren
--------------------------------------

Simpledrums is a simple MESS-synth sampler (MusE Experimental Soft
Synth) aiming at becoming a simple, tightly integrated sampler for
MusE, specifically aimed at drumsamples.

Features:
- 16 channels/samples (1 sample/channel)
- Simple controls for each individual channel: volume, balance, noteoff-ignore, channel on/off
- Main volume
- 4 LADSPA send-effects can be used, 4 effect taps for each individual channel
- All channel parameters are controllable via the GUI, or by MusE:s controller handling (controller pane in pianoroll/drumeditor)
- All effect parameters can be controlled via the GUI, or by Sysex messages (f.ex. turn effect on/off, modify effect parameters)
- Complete synth state (fx-parameters, samples etc) is saved together with MusE project, and restored later when loaded
- Samples automatically resampled when loaded (if needed)

That's all folks!

-------------
Known issues:
-------------
- Not the prettiest gui in the world
- All samples are read directly into memory (no caching)
- Some obscure LADSPA-effects make SimpleSynth segfault
- More...

-------------
Future plans:
-------------
- Fix all the known issues! ;-)
- Sample loops
- Sample offset variation w respect to note velocity
- Treble/eq-controller for each individual channel
- Treble level variation w respect to note velocity
- More...
