# The basic idea:  The UI is completely detached from the underlying
# audio/MIDI engine, and communicates with it via a well defined protocol of messages (and by saving files to disk then notifying to re-read the file)
# There's no chance in hell of the UI crashing the audio engine UNLESS by a bad message or file,
# which if that does happen, it will be very easy to track down and fix so that it never happens again...  Genius, right?
