# The basic idea:  A non-linear DAW, since every other DAW on the planet is excessively linear.
# A song contains X number of 8 bar regions.  Regions contain per-track items.  Items contain events.
# Events can be a MIDI note event, a MIDI CC event for automation, or playing back an audio file(?)
# The placement of an item with in a region determines what bar the item starts on in the song, but
# items within the bar may be longer than 1 bar.  The UI is completely detached from the underlying
# audio/MIDI engine, and communicates with it via a well defined protocol, which will allow easily 
# replacing the UI with a different UI, as well as safe customization of the UI.

Miscellaneous TODO:
Create some kind of song->region dialog, like when clicking in a region in the song editor, prompt to make new or copy from another...  Create a region->item dialog to do the same...
Context menus?  Stuff like, insert, delete, etc...
Euphoria: Dynamically allocate per-sample data at sample load
Create a tabwidget for the main area, and move the item editor to a new tab.  Later I can add audio and MIDI event lists...
