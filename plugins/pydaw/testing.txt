Manual regression tests for certifying a PyDAW release:

1.  Recording:  Verify that notes, CCs and pitchbends record correctly
2.  Playback:  Verify that each plugins(and track type) can play back correctly notes, CCs and pitchbends
3.  Project saving:  Verify that instrument state is recalled as it was saved for each plugin/track-type...
4.  Delete the ~/pydaw folder and launch a brand new project
5.  Valgrind a full, busy project...
6.  Test all of the editing functionality in the song, region and item editors...
