Qtractor - An Audio/MIDI multi-track sequencer
----------------------------------------------

Qtractor is still in some alpha stage of development,
although already functional. It surely has a plenty of
lurking bugs. It also lacks some features that some might
find critical in the application field. All is not lost,
as the following are among the ones planned to be worked
on in the times to come (not in any particular order):

- MIDI step-recording.
- Audio/MIDI files resource management.
- Audio clip auto-crossfading.
- Clip locking, muting and plug-ins.
- JACK MIDI support.
- OSC interface.
- Scripting.
- etc. etc.

- Any other feature one can think of ;)
