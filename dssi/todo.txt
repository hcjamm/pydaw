A maximum sustain time to avoid hung notes
Add pulse width to the square waveform, as another function that accepts an additional 0 to 1 width parameter
Add curve to the ramp envelope
Filter knob needs more resolution, and/or more smoothing
Create attack offset in ADSR, via a new function
LFO


Do envelope knobs as a percentage of the total knob range, and standardize knob ranges (this should be done in svf.h, for example, _set_cutoff(ptr, -1_to_1 value)  )  Create methods to set the values(from smoothed and unsmoothed streams), and one method to actually calculate.





Long term:
