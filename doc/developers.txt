Structure:

	These are the important files of a LMS plugin:

	[directory]/src/synth.h
			synth.c
			libmodsynth.h
			synth_qt_gui.h
			synth_qt_gui.cpp
			meta.h
			../../libmodsynth/*


	synth.h:  defines and types to be used by synth.c

	meta.h:   Meta-data such as developer/maintainer info and plugin name, to be used globally

	synth_qt_gui.h:  header file for synth_qt_gui.cpp

	synth_qt_gui.cpp:  The Qt/C++ file for the GUI

	synth.c:  Implements DSSI, and the synthesizer's main loop

	../../libmodsynth/* :  The libmodsynth library, including audio synthesis/processing modules, and other functions

Compiling/Debugging/Forking:

	LibModSynth uses a custom build system written in Perl to simplify the build process.  See instructions.txt for details.

The library:

	LibModSynth provides a library of useful functions and types for developers.  The library is still a work-in-progress.  It's documentation can be found in the files themselves.

	LibModSynth is not a shared library, but meant to be used as source code compiled into each application.  This provides greater performance with a neglible increase in memory usage.  The folder structure was setup to facilitate this kind of workflow.
