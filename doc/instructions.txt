How to debug using GDB and an IDE:

	Create a project in your IDE of choice from the ./debugger/main.c and Makefile(LMS is developed in Netbeans, this functionality has not been tested in other IDEs).
	Create a project for the plugin you wish to debug if you haven't already done so.
	Set any breakpoints you wish to set.
	Begin debugging in your IDE.  Your IDE will allow you to stop at any of your breakpoints and examine the state of your plugin.

How to create .deb packages:
	
	Package all plugins in a single .deb(preferred):

	perl build-all.pl
	#answer a few questions
	

	Package a single plugin(be careful not to create conflicts with multi-plugin packages)

	cd lms-filter  #or whatever plugin you want to package
	perl build.pl --deb
	#answer questions

How to fork a plugin automatically:

	Run this command in the directory of the plugin you want to fork:

	perl build.pl --fork

	, answer a few questions, and the script will copy the folder and update all meta-data and compiling information.

	If you're committing it to a git repository, you may want to run this command afterwards:

	perl build.pl --git-add

How to fork a plugin manually:

	Make a copy of the plugin folder you want to fork, place it in libmodsynth-git and rename it

	in <plugin>/src/meta.h , update the plugin information

	in <plugin>/src/Makefile.am , CTRL+F replace lms_filter with lms_comb (or whatever other names)

	update <plugin>/build.pl with the new plugin info

	run perl build.pl -f

	Delete any IDE specific folders like nbproject in your plugin folder

	Now you can load the project in your IDE

	The appropriate files can be added to git with:
	git add src/dssi.h src/libmodsynth.h src/Makefile.am src/synth.c src/synth.h src/synth_qt_gui.cpp src/meta.h src/synth_qt_gui.h build.pl Makefile.am configure.ac
